# Management Reviews and 9.3

When implementing ISO 27001, the term "management review" represents a critical process that's super useful and a little bit feared by teams pursuing accreditation. Management reviews are an essential part of an Information Security Management System (ISMS) and demonstrate to auditors your organisation's commitment to information security, whilst providing an excellent mechanism for review and improvement.

For newcomers to the standard this can feel difficult or clunky - and it needs to be remembered that the standard is not just about implementation but maintenance and continuous improvement. This is a perfect example of a function that may feel out of place or difficult on it's first use, but that is incredibly valuable as an ongoing function for continuous review and improvement.

## What is Management Review? 
An internal management review is simply a formalised, structured meeting where your organisation's leadership evaluates the ISMS. ISO 27001 clause 9.3.1 states: "Top management shall review the organization's information security management system at planned intervals to ensure its continuing suitability, adequacy and effectiveness."

This is all about comparing efforts taken so far with the ideal objectives of the ISMS;

- Suitability: The ISMS aligns with your organisation's context and objectives
- Adequacy: The design meets your organisation's needs
- Effectiveness: The ISMS delivers intended results

## Why Management Reviews Matter 
Management reviews serve several critical purposes:

- Demonstrating Leadership Commitment: Management reviews show top management's commitment to information security. Auditors scrutinize leadership involvement in the ISMS during certification.
- Continuous Improvement: The standard requires continuous improvement of your ISMS. The review process identifies improvement opportunities systematically (and evidences that such a mechanism exists).
- Audit Preparation: Regular reviews help identify gaps and address non-conformities before external audits occur. The process itself is valuable when appropriately used.
- Strategic Alignment: Regular reviews ensure information security efforts remain aligned with evolving business objectives.
- Balancing Implementation with Maintenance: Management reviews bridge the gap between initial ISMS design and ongoing maintenance. This can feel weird during first implementation, as you're simultaneously building systems while reviewing their effectiveness. This feeling of friction is normal and part of the continuous improvement cycle central to ISO 27001. It's worth remembering that the standard is written for users who already have an ISMS in place, so you'll occasionally come to sections or processes as an implementor where the standard doesn't quite feel like it's useful - these are the sections that it's vital to bake into processes for next year.

## When to Conduct Management Reviews 
The timing of management reviews must be carefully planned:

- The standard requires reviews at "planned intervals" - but doesn't prescribe a frequency. The de-facto is 'annually', but make sure this is a decision you make based on your own interests and goals. Think about other key validations and reviews that ought to happen yearly, and think about whether the review should be placed before or after these if controls, subscriptions, processes or staffing is likely to change.
- Before a Stage 1 Audit: You must provide evidence during a Stage 1 audit that regular reviews are conducted. In the UK, it is in preparation for a stage 1 audit that newcomers first identify that they will need to produce and execute a plan for an Internal Audit. Conduct at least one review before your initial certification audit.
- After Significant Changes: Schedule additional reviews after major organisational changes, security incidents, or when new threats emerge. This should be a process that can be rolled out as a follow-on to your incident response plan or business continuity plan.
- During Implementation: For organisations implementing ISO 27001, conduct more frequent reviews to establish effective monitoring patterns. This is where it can become very useful to try and bake information security into a standing business item. The Management review is a very important part of the feedback loop of any ISMS, and is a leverage point for making key changes.

## Who Should Attend 
The 'management' review suggests specific participants:

- Top Management: Senior management must lead the review. ISO 27001 explicitly requires top management involvement.
- Information Security Manager: The person responsible for daily ISMS operations provides operational insights.
- Department Representatives: Include key department heads to ensure comprehensive coverage of all business units.
- Risk Owners: Include people identified as risk owners in your risk assessment to address risk treatment effectiveness.
- Internal Auditors or consultants: Optional but valuable for providing independent assessment perspectives. This is not necessarily about compliance - have third-party standard expertise can provide useful insights into the design of the standard to ease friction points or clear up disagreements without organisational buy-in.

## Essential Agenda Items 
Your management review must address specific topics defined in ISO 27001 clause 9.3.2:

- Previous Actions: "The status of actions from previous management reviews" (9.3.2.a)
- Context Changes: "Changes in external and internal issues that are relevant to the information security management system" (9.3.2.b)
- Interested Party Changes: "Changes in needs and expectations of interested parties that are relevant to the information security management system" (9.3.2.c)
- ISMS Performance: "Feedback on the information security performance, including trends in:
  - Nonconformities and corrective actions
  - Monitoring and measurement results
  - Audit results
  - Fulfillment of information security objectives" (9.3.2.d)
- Stakeholder Feedback: "Feedback from interested parties" (9.3.2.e)
- Risk Treatment: "Results of risk assessment and status of risk treatment plan" (9.3.2.f)
- Improvement Opportunities: "Opportunities for continual improvement" (9.3.2.g)
- Technical Controls Testing: Test and evaluate technical controls including:
  - User endpoint device security
  - Access controls and authentication
  - Malware protection
  - Backups and recovery systems
  - Monitoring systems
- Resource Needs: Determine if the ISMS has adequate resources (human, technical, financial) as required in clause 7.1.



 This is easy enough to cover as a conversation with effective note taking, but will require effective preparation if it is to be completed in a timely manner. Consider delegation for the collection and preparation of this information. For smaller teams, consider a preliminary meeting that outlines what data needs to be collected and gives reasonable timeframes to collect it and make it presentable. Consider also that this data should already be available in a timely fashion as a component of the monitoring function of the ISMS, so if you find any frustrations in collecting this data, take that as an opportunity for continuous improvement, and find a way to get your hands on it more easily.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid 
Several common mistakes undermine effective management reviews:

Combining with Regular Meetings: Separate management reviews from operational meetings. Security concerns frequently get deprioritized when combined with urgent business matters, so make time for strategic meetings that cover broader and longer term topics. Make sure everyone is aware of this distinction.
Insufficient Documentation: ISO 27001 clause 9.3.3 requires: "Documented information shall be available as evidence of the results of management reviews." Keep detailed minutes to track decisions and required actions, and classify and protect it accordingly.
Treating It as Compliance Only: Management reviews deliver strategic value beyond mere compliance. Use them to genuinely improve security posture! If you find that what is being covered is boring, examine whether you've got the right information.
Too Many Participants: Maintain a focused group of necessary stakeholders.
Inadequate Preparation: Worth repeating: Gather all required data and reports before the meeting. This includes metrics, audit findings, and risk assessments. If the meeting is underway and we find substantial data is missing, reschedule!

## Practical Implementation Tips 
Effective management reviews require structure and preparation:

Create a Template: Develop a standard agenda addressing each requirement in clause 9.3.2. This ensures consistent coverage of all required elements. This makes it a lot easier to feel confident in how you're meeting the requirements of the standard, and provides easier standardised evidence for an auditor.
Document Everything: Clause 9.3.3 states: "The results of the management review shall include decisions related to continual improvement opportunities and any needs for changes to the information security management system."
Focus on Actionable Outcomes: Document specific actions with assigned responsibilities and deadlines for completion. Make sure all actions taken away are SMART Objectives.
Keep Meetings Efficient: Conduct focused 1-2 hour meetings with clear objectives - and a break or two!
Separate Documentation Types: Maintain both detailed minutes for compliance and briefer summaries for operational use. Senior managers or attendees should keep notes of anything they don't entirely understand and pursue a development of knowledge in this area.

## First Review Considerations 
Initial management reviews differ from subsequent reviews:

Schedule your first management review before your Stage 1 certification audit to demonstrate compliance.
Focus on establishing baseline measurements rather than trend analysis. Instead of worrying about 'how effective' efforts are when the data doesn't exist yet, make sure that you have mechanisms for generating all that is required over the next 6 months or so.
Document the ISMS implementation status across all control areas.
Address each required element from clause 9.3.2, even when there is no historical data.
Establish tracking mechanisms for actions that result from this initial review.
Consider a smaller attendee list for this first, more procedural review. 

## v The Continuous Improvement Cycle - One more reminder... 
To make it very very clear and repeat myself for maybe the third time in this one - the first management review will feel a little strange and at odds with itself.

Management reviews represent a fundamental aspect of the continuous improvement cycle in ISO 27001. This creates tension during initial implementation, as you simultaneously build systems while reviewing their effectiveness.

The ongoing maintenance mindset required for ISO 27001 often feels incongruent with the initial design and build activities. Early reviews may seem premature when systems are still being established. This tension is intentional and promotes a mindset - and also reminds us that the standard is just as useful for maintenance and improvement as it is for implementation.
