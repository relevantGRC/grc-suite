# ISO 27001:2022

An ISO standard outlining the requirements for planning, implementing, maintaining, and continuously improving an Information Security Management System (ISMS). It's made up of clauses that produce requirements for conformity. If properly attended and implemented, it is a fantastic resource for developing not only and ISMS, but an in-house understanding and respect of Information Security.

ISO/IEC 27001 requires that management:

Systematically examine the organisation's information security risks, taking account of the threats, vulnerabilities, and impacts of these eventuating;
Plan and implement a relevant and comprehensive body of information security controls and/or other forms of risk treatment (such as risk avoidance or risk transfer) to address those risks that are deemed unacceptable; and
Adopt an overarching management process (system) to ensure that the information security controls continue to meet the organisation's information security needs on an ongoing basis.
