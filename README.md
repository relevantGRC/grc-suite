## Disclaimers

1. This is a personal project and does not represent or reflect the views, opinions, or work of my current employer, Clario, or any previous employers.

2. The code, configurations, and resources in this repository are for **educational purposes only**. While they demonstrate security concepts, they should not be used directly in production environments without proper review, testing, and customization for your specific security and compliance requirements.

## Project Vision

This GRC Suite is my initiative to empower Governance, Risk, and Compliance professionals with technical implementation skills. Drawing from my cybersecurity experience and deep expertise in GRC Engineering and Auditing, I've created this repository to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and hands-on expertise, comprehensive guidance, and a structured portfolio framework.

My mission is to create the industry's premier open-source resource for GRC professionals to demonstrate practical GRC skills through guided, hands-on experiences that directly align with best practices.
