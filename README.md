## Disclaimers

1. This is a personal project and does not represent or reflect the views, opinions, or work of my current employer, Clario, or any previous employers.

2. The code, configurations, and resources in this repository are for **educational purposes only**. While they demonstrate security concepts, they should not be used directly in production environments without proper review, testing, and customization for your specific security and compliance requirements.

## Project Vision

This GRC Suite is my initiative to empower Governance, Risk, and Compliance professionals with technical implementation skills. Drawing from my cybersecurity experience and deep expertise in GRC Engineering and Auditing, I've created this repository to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and hands-on expertise, comprehensive guidance, and a structured portfolio framework.

My mission is to create the industry's premier open-source resource for GRC professionals to demonstrate practical GRC skills through guided, hands-on experiences that directly align with best practices.

## About the Author

I'm [Nathaniel Konu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nkonu/), a cybersecurity professional with nearly 15 years of experience specializing in GRC Engineering, compliance automation, risk management, and security operation. My journey includes:

- **Auditing Excellence**: At Insight Assurance, helped with the growth of the audit practice, advancing from junior auditor to staff auditor.
- **Consulting Success**: At SkyTech Consulting, a compliance automation consultancy, focusing on NIST, ISO Seriees, FedRamp, SOC 2 and HIPAA automation
- **Corporate Innovation**: Served as a Senior GRC at npd, leading GRC and innovation initiatives including a GRC automation tool. 
- **YouTube Learning**: Teach courses on GRC, cloud compliance and automation on my Youtube channel including GRC courses. 
- **Current Role**: Senior GRC Engineering at Clario

Throughout my career, I've been driven by the mission to make compliance more efficient and accessible through automation and merging engineering principles with compliance. This grc suite represents my experiences and lessons learned in GRC.

## What's Inside

- **Hands-on Labs**: Comprehensive, step-by-step labs covering core security and GRC domains
- **Full Code Implementations**: Complete CloudFormation templates for all labs
- **Advanced Challenges**: Stretch goals and real-world scenarios to demonstrate advanced skills
- **Learning Resources**: Curated references, comparison charts, and learning paths

## Repository Structure

This repository is part of a progressive release strategy for my youtube channel  [RelevantGrc: Secure by design, Compliant by default](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClRL3C3I8eWrlbISV1n1Bgg). Currently, it includes:
