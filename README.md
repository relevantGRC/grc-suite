## Disclaimers

This is a **personal, independent project**.  
It does **not** represent or reflect the views, opinions, or work of my current employer or any previous employers.

The content provided here — including code, configurations, and documentation — is **for educational purposes only**.  
While these resources demonstrate real-world security and compliance concepts, **they should not be deployed in production without**:
- Independent review  
- Appropriate security testing  
- Customization for your project or organization’s specific requirements  

## Project Vision

The **GRC Suite** is designed to **empower Governance, Risk, and Compliance professionals** with **technical, hands-on skills**.

Too often, GRC knowledge remains theoretical. This project closes that gap by offering:
- **Actionable labs** that bring frameworks to life
- **Templates and mappings** that accelerate implementation
- **Guided exercises** that align with industry best practices

This GRC Suite is my initiative to empower Governance, Risk, and Compliance professionals with technical implementation skills. Drawing from my cybersecurity experience and deep expertise in GRC Engineering and Auditing, I've created this repository to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and hands-on expertise, comprehensive guidance, and a structured portfolio framework.

**Mission:** is to build the industry's **go-to open-source resource** for GRC practitioners who want to:
1. Demonstrate practical technical skills  
2. Learn by doing — not just reading  
3. Showcase their capabilities through a structured portfolio  

## About the Author

I'm [Nathaniel Konu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nkonu/), a cybersecurity professional with nearly 15 years of experience specializing in GRC Engineering, compliance automation, risk management, and security operation. My journey includes:

- **Auditing Excellence**: At Insight Assurance, helped with the growth of the audit practice, advancing from junior auditor to staff auditor.
- **Consulting Success**: At SkyTech Consulting, a compliance automation consultancy, focusing on NIST, ISO Seriees, FedRamp, SOC 2 and HIPAA automation
- **Corporate Innovation**: Served as a Senior GRC at npd, leading GRC and innovation initiatives including a GRC automation tool. 
- **YouTube Learning**: Teach courses on GRC, cloud compliance and automation on my Youtube channel including GRC courses. 
- **Current Role**: Senior GRC Engineering at Clario

**Core Belief:** Compliance should be **efficient**, **accessible**, and **integrated** — blending engineering principles with GRC frameworks to enable "secure by design, compliant by default."

## Repository Structure

This repository is part of a progressive release strategy for my youtube channel  [RelevantGrc: Secure by design, Compliant by default](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClRL3C3I8eWrlbISV1n1Bgg). Currently, it includes:
